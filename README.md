# Cryptocurrency Advisor

This notebook clusters cryptocurrencies by their performance in different time periods. We will plot the results so that we can visually show the performance to the board. This proposed idea will not only depend on returns and volatility, rather factors that might impact the crypto marketâ€”leading to better performance for your portfolio.

## Technologies

This project uses a Jupyter Notebook in Jupyter Lab with the following libraries:

- Pandas: to help with the robust amount of features that will help analyze and organize the data.
- HvPlot: to create interactive data visualizations that are visually pleasing to the audience
- scikit-learn: to import the **K-means algorithm** which will identify clusters to solve clustering business problems, **PCA** a statistical technique that we use to speed up machine learning algorithms when too many features, or dimensions, exist, and the **Standard Scaler** which will help normalize and scale data so that it is easily comparable.
